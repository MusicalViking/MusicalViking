## 🪖 Code Warrior. Veteran. Builder of Second Chances.

I served with the 5th SFG from 2001–2003.
I Came home broken, lost a friend, nearly lost myself.
Then I found purpose in code.

**No handouts. No shortcuts. One mission: Build tools that matter.**

## 🧠 From the Inside Out

> In 2023, after 20-years into a prison sentence with zero tech background.
> No laptop experience. No GitHub. No roadmap. Just fire.

- Everything started for me from joining a basic web design course through Brave Behind Bars while in prison.
- Taught myself full-stack dev in isolation — Flask, JS, Jinja, CLI scripting
- Earned certifications from **Google**, **UC Davis**, **University of Michigan** and every online course I could find!
- Went from student to TA — teaching others to build the same way I did
- Now I build software that runs offline, under pressure, and without excuses

## ⚔️ My Ethos

- **Code like your life depends on it.**
- **No fluff. No gimmicks. Just raw function and impact.**
- **If it doesn’t run offline, it’s not ready for the real world.**
- **Accessibility > Aesthetics. Clarity > Cleverness.**
